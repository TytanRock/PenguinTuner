# What does Penguin Tuner support?

Penguin Tuner supports everything necessary to get a robot up-and-running.

This includes:
 - Listing all devices
 - Changing Device ID's
 - Changing Device Names
 - Blink Devices to ID them
 - Firmware-Upgrading devices
 - Perform Self-Test Snapshots

# What will Penguin Tuner Support?

Ideally, Penguin Tuner will support everything that Phoenix Tuner supports, but I may never get to that point due to it taking too long, or there being limitations in GTK that I cannot get around.

Realistically, I'd expect Penguin Tuner to support the following in the future:
 - Configs: This is the next big item on my To-Do list
 - Plotting: This might be a long while, due to there being so few good live-data plotters out there. I may end up creating my own live-data plotter for this purpose.
   - Live plotting
   - Record Plots in CSV format (or similar)
